                But now the suitors trooped in with all their swagger and took their seats on low and high-backed chairs. Heralds poured water over their hands for rinsing, serving maids brought bread heaped high in trays
                and the young men brimmed the mixing-bowls with wine. They reached out for the good things that lay at hand, and when they’d put aside desire for food and drink
                the suitors set their minds on other pleasures,
                song and dancing, all that crowns a feast.
                A herald placed an ornate lyre in Phemius’ hands, the bard who always performed among them there; they forced the man to sing.
                </p>
                <p>
                A rippling prelude— and no sooner had he struck up his rousing song
                than Telemachus, head close to Athena’s sparkling eyes, spoke low to his guest so no one else could hear:
                “Dear stranger, would you be shocked by what I say? Look at them over there. Not a care in the world,
                just lyres and tunes! Easy for them, all right,
                they feed on another’s goods and go scot-free—
                a man whose white bones lie strewn in the rain somewhere, rotting away on land or rolling down the ocean’s salty swells. But that man—if they caught sight of him home in Ithaca, by god, they’d all pray to be faster on their feet
                than richer in bars of gold and heavy robes.
                </p>
                <p>
                But now, no use, he’s died a wretched death. No comfort’s left for us ... not even if
                someone, somewhere, says he’s coming home. The day of his return will never dawn.
